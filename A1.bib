abstract = {The voxel-based models are used extensively in many fields, such as medical image reconstruction, volume rendering and fluid dynamics, etc. Especially in robotics, voxel-based model is a powerful tool to execute collision detection. Voxelization refers to a process to convert data from one source type into a three dimensional volume dataset. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to voxelize the polygonal meshes into contour voxel representation based on the octree structure. It is proved that our algorithm is efficient and effective to voxelize 3D polygon mesh models into voxel representation, which makes it possible to be employed in robotics and current CAD systems for true solid modeling with particular interior attributes, such as colors, density and materials, etc.},

@article{NOBLE1988,
abstract = {The shape of the femoral canal is variable, much more variable, in fact, than most contemporary designs of femoral components would suggest or can accommodate. In the face of this variability, line-to-line or surface-to-surface contact is not expected between cementless implants and much of the endosteal surface. It also is apparent that changes in implant design are still needed if the normal biomechanics of the hip joint are to be restored in each patient and if component fixation is to be optimized. Most cementless components aim to achieve proximal load transfer to the femoral canal. However, increasing clinical evidence suggests that distal filling of the femur also is necessary to minimize the incidence of postoperative symptoms, particularly in revision procedures. If this is indeed the case, more accommodating designs of femoral components are needed that will enable proximal and distal fitting at the femoral canal so that stable fixation may be achieved regardless of variations in bone geometry.
